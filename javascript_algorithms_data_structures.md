# Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms

For playing around with JS in an interactive console, navigate to any browser console. 



### Declaration and Initialization of Variables:

- variables global by default
- to declare a variable use the `var` keyword
- to initialize, assign the variable a value. 
- no need to declare a variable before using it, but it's good convention to do so. 
- initial assignment is optional: ex: these are all valid. 

``` javascript
var number; 
var name; 
var hi = 123; 
var flag = false; 
```
### JS Math Library

[Link to Docs for Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)

- all properties and methods of `Math` are static, `Math` is not a constructor. 
- implementation dependent (could get different mathematical results on different browsers)

to truncate numbers (reduced precision), try:
```javascript
var z = 34565.4323432
print(z.toFixed(2))
```

### Decision Constructs 

While:
- `if`
- `if else`
- `if else if`

are allowed in JS, a cleaner decision construct is `switch`:

```javascript
putstr()
```
